# Smart - UI

# Hi!
 I am Manan Goyal, a 3rd year CSE Undergrad student of IIT Bombay. Smart UI was a great opportunity and I got to learn a lot of things. I took this project entirely by myself due to which I had to put in more efforts probably, but seeing the results, I believe it was worth it! I would like to thank team Tech-fest and Morning Star for sharing this opportunity with me.

Looking forward to more such opportunities â€¦

# Installation on Ubuntu 20

1.
## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- PHP / cli
- Tesseract - ocr library

1. For extended version

- ImageMagic libraries - convert source .png files

1.
## REQUIREMENTS INSTALLATION

### Debian+Ubuntu

sudo apt install php7.4-cli

sudo apt-get install php-mbstring

sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

sudo apt install imagemagick

MacOS

**PHP**

PHP is MAMP part

or use Homebreww

brew search php

brew install php / or / php@7.3

**Tesseract**

brew install tesseract --all-languages

**Imagemagick**

brew install imagemagick

1.
## SMART\_UI Installation

1. **SmartUI.tgz ungzip/untar to directory**

tar -xzvf smartui\_xxx.tgz

1. **set permissions for directories**

chmod 755 smart\_ui -R

chmod 777 smart\_ui/\*.php

and / or

chown [myaccount] smart\_ui -R

## D. APPLICATION STRUCURE

conf/ - configuration file / system paths

vendor/ - PHP libraries / see composer.json

**System folders**

_source\_imgs /_

images for parsing

_encoded\_sources /_

helper encoded images for better results - encoded with imagemagick library convert

images created by 1.tesseract\_parser\_extended.php

_process\_data /_

output tesseract ocr process in HTML

created by

1.tesseract\_parser.php

1.tesseract\_parser\_extended.php

parse\_image-cli.php

_grid\_recognized /_

file database with overlapping output from different parsing methods

filenames and serialized php arrays in files in understandable structure for extending

and finetuning json output

created by

3.grid2josn-extended.php

3.grid2josn.php

_output\_json /_

json file per image

created by

2.elements2grid.php

## E. USER GUIDE

SmartUI is CLI application, run from command line

Put images in .png format are parsed from **source\_imgs** folder

Parsing only one specific image for testing, debuging could be done with

php ./parse\_image-cli.php path-to-image.png

Parsing all images with helper files

php

# Stages

Batch rendering more images:

(blue - command)

1.
## Parse with tesseract

add \*.png images to ./source\_imgs

php ./1.tesseract\_parser.php

results in ./process\_data/[image filename]/[methodname.html]

1.
## Reparse output to &quot;zones db&quot;

php ./2.elements2grid.php

1.
## Generate json output

php ./3.grid2json.php

# **TLDR :**

copy images to source\_imgs/

just run the **./smart\_ui.sh**

or

just run the following scripts as **./[filename].php :**

1.tesseract\_parser.php

2.elements2grid.php

3.grid2json.php

# Next steps, what can be improved

smart\_UI structure is prepeared for next extending

zone db is open for properties from different parsing, recognizing, learning tools

Use teseract to &quot;ocr&quot; recognizing html5 form elements,

train library for this &quot;specific font&quot;.

Use an imagemagick histogram for extending elements with color and box properties.

Use autotracer + tesselart for html5 boxes and elements.

# Other good solutions for your information

other ways:

( but I don&#39;t recommend switch to it, my solution is extendable

also with some internal logic - &quot;AI&quot; )

1.

- GoogleCloudVision API

2.

- really impressive scientific project:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07962](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07962)

( problematic is fast instalation with python libraries

- and solution in short time will be only interface

for already &quot;learned&quot; parsing)
